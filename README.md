## General Information

- This project is a copy of a restaurant website that I had to create by using webpack and JavaScript only. The main purpose of this project was to learn how to create website in JavaScript and to learn how to use Webpack.

## Project Status

Project is: _complete_.

## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:

- Instead of functions, classes could be used which would make the code more modular and compact.
- the markup and CSS could be streamlined

## Acknowledgements
